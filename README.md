# Minecraft Zombie Apocalypse
(I will add a screenshot later)

## Initialization
1. Put the datapack in your world (change `Megarion` to your own name in `data/za/functions/playerjoin.mcfunction`)
2. Run `/function za:util/setspawn` to set a spawnpoint and a border
3. Run `/function za:start` (or `/function za:init` to remove the wait at the beginning) to start the game
